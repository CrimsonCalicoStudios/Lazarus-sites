        <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
        <p id="abt">
            We are <span style="color: #12ba7c;">Edens Gate</span> and our goal is to revolutionise the way you live, the way you feel and utimately, the way you exist. <br>
            <br>
            We started as a game development company founded by ▇▇▇▇▇ just making games for our own and others enjoyment. Whilst working that industry we had to keep up the developing technologies around us <br>
            That was when we decided to look into developing our own technologies to help us stand out from the crowd, keep our supporters entertained whilst learning more and more about the world around us.
            <br><br>
            We started with the "Nanotronic Game Mat©" which simulated environments while in vr so it actually felt like you were there walking on grass, gravel or wherever you were and it sold so well we just had to keep making more.
            <br>
            The "EchoSphere VR Chamber©" was the next big seller. One of our personal favourites, we stil.l have many around the office for testing but also for our team to relax on their breaks, this was a real pain to design but the ending is one of our proudest moments, revolutionising virtual reality from the comfort of your own home with scents, air control, liquid simulation/weather simulation and much more!
            <br><br>
            The next big thing is already in development under the name "Project: Lazarus", unfortuanately thats all we can say at this moment but keep your eyes open because it's a big one.
